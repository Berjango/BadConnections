USE AT OWN RISK. NO GUARANTEES THAT THIS PROGRAM WORKS.

This program is designed to show bad tcp connections to your computer.
It is not 100% accurate and will produce false positives and false negatives which hopefully will be the minority.
This program has proved to be extremely useful for me but may not be for anyone else.

To run ,type the following line in a terminal

perl badconnections.pl


AT a later stage ,this program will also show which bad connections have not been blocked yet and may give an option to block them.
