USE AT OWN RISK. NO GUARANTEES THAT THIS PROGRAM WORKS.

This program is designed to show bad tcp connections to your computer.
It is not 100% accurate and will produce false positives and false negatives which hopefully will be the minority.
This program has proved to be extremely useful for me but may not be for anyone else.

requires the ufw firewall program to be installed,can still be of limited use without it.

To run ,type the following line in a terminal

perl badconnections.pl


Currently only ipv4 but will be ipv6 compatible in the future.
